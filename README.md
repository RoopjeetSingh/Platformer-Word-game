**Platformer Word Game**

This is a game made using python and its library pygame. The game has two different steps, the first part is a platformer game where 
we collect letters. In the second part we use the letters to make words. You get points based on how big the word is and the number of words.

There is a total time for both the parts. Using more time in one part, leaves less time for the second part.
